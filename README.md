# RichText.org: a place to share things™

There exists many places on the internet to store plain text, and even Markdown, but there are not any good places that exist to serve the basic needs of myself — to copy/paste simple rich text (including images) into a sharable link.

That's what this service intends to be.

## Technology

Going to keep it pretty basic, and use this as an excuse to get familiar with Django 2.0. 

- Django 2.0
- Postgres or DynamoDB
- "HTML5"
    - https://mindmup.github.io/bootstrap-wysiwyg/
- Heroku

That's basically it!

**Please note:** *this is a work in progress*.
